Module 12 NoSQL Challenge

All of work is in the starter  code folder.

The assignment contains three parts:
  1. Databasea and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
  2. Update the Database
  3. Exploratory Analysis

This showcases the ability to utilize mongo to use a database within jupyter notebook and proceed to update the rows on 
the database for cleanup, such as possible missing elements or wrong data types for fields.

Part three, the bulk of the assignment, was running queries and even a pipeline to answer questions about the data stored on the 
database about certain parameters on Restaurants in the UK.

Thanks for reading! :))
